# NinjaTrader 8
Source code for some NT8 indicators. Basically, these indicators are things I have found useful and wanted to share with some friends.

## Instructions for use
Take the source code from here and paste into a new NinjaScript file in your Indicators folder. 
Another way would be to copy the file into *My Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\Indicators*.

It should be able to compile and be usable. 

Feel free to create issues if you find them.
